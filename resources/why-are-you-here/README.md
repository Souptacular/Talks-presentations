### Why Are You Here? 

An ETHBerlin talk by Jordan Spence, CMO at MyCrypto.

---

This talk was designed to get the hackers into a good headspace before the hackathon began. It touches on figuring out and learning a few key points:

* Why are you here?
* Why do you want to build?
* What do you want to build?
* You can change the world by changing your world
* You don't have to code to build
* Everything starts with an idea

The video of the talk is waiting to be uploaded by ETHBerlin staff.
